## TBD
#### Feature Enhancements

    Filter Enhancements:
        Add more granular filters (e.g., by repository, workflow name, or specific time intervals).
        Include a "Reset Filters" button to revert to the default state.

    Detailed Drill-Downs:
        Allow clicking on a bar or line in the graph to display detailed information (e.g., workflow logs, specific job durations).
        Open a modal or side panel for these details.

    Comparison Mode:
        Allow comparing trends or workflow times across repositories or workflows in side-by-side graphs.

    Export Data:
        Provide an option to export filtered data as a CSV, Excel, or PDF file.

#### Improvements

    Dashboard Navigation:
        Replace tabs with a sidebar for easier navigation if more sections are added in the future.
        Include icons next to tab/section names for clarity.

    Modern Graph Animations:
        Introduce animations like sliding bars, easing effects, or progressive line drawing for graphs.

    Empty States:
        Display helpful messages or illustrations for empty data (e.g., "No failures recorded today" or "No workflows found for the selected range").

    Interactive Tooltips:
        Enhance tooltips with more details, such as percentage changes compared to the previous period.
        Allow clicking on a tooltip to navigate to related logs or details.

    Cards for Key Metrics:
        Add summary cards at the top of the dashboard:
            Total Workflows Run
            Total Billable Minutes
            Number of Failures
        Use icons and bold text to make these visually distinct.

#### Advanced Features

    User Customization:
        Allow users to save their preferred filters or dashboard layouts.

    Heatmaps:
        Use heatmaps to show workflow activity across days and times (e.g., most active hours/days).

    Integrated Notifications:
        Send email or Slack notifications for failed workflows or significant usage spikes.

    Performance Optimizations:
        Lazy load graphs and data to improve initial page load times.
        Use skeleton loaders while data is being fetched.

#### Small Tweaks

    Responsive Design:
        Optimize the layout for different screen sizes (e.g., better graph scaling for tablets).

    Micro-Interactions:
        Add subtle hover effects and animations for buttons, cards, and graphs.

#### Future Scope

    Multi-User Support:
        If this is for a team, add user profiles and permissions for managing workflows and data.

    Integration with GitHub:
        Show recent commits or PRs linked to each workflow.
